# Automate Boring Stuff  With Python exercise with ChatGPT
I was studying python through: Automate Boring Stuff With Python. Whenever I encounter a concept that I'm not fully confident with, I ask chatGPT to create a quiz so I can practice more about it, and also strengthen my python coding skill at the same time. Although many of these exercises are beginner-level, I'm documenting them to track my growth over time.

-印出1加到10的過程與總和--練習for迴圈: for loop excercise
